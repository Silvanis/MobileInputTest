# MobileInputTest

This is a test program, created to explore iPhone/mobile development.
Besides the general running on a mobile device, this project focused on
working with various forms of touch input.

The game controls are:
-tapping the top left of the screen will jump
-holding the bottom left of the screen will crouch
-tapping anywhere on the right side will fire a burger

Multi-touch is supported, so jumping or crouching while firing is possible.
